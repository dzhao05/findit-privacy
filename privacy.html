  <h1>Privacy Policy for FindIt</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> June 25, 2025</p>
  <p>FindIt (“we”, “our”, or “the App”) is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes how we handle your information and what data, if any, we collect, store, or share.</p>

  <h2>1. Overview</h2>
  <p>FindIt is a personal productivity app that helps you record and locate rarely used items—such as light bulbs, tools, batteries—by logging their location using text, photos, or voice input. All user data is stored locally on the device. We do not collect, store, or transmit personal data to external servers.</p>

  <h2>2. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Your name, email address, phone number, or any personally identifiable information (PII)</li>
    <li>Your item data (names, locations, categories, notes)</li>
    <li>Your voice recordings or audio files</li>
    <li>Any device identifiers or location data</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Information You May Enter</h2>
  <p>You may choose to enter the following information for your own organizational purposes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Item name and location</li>
    <li>Optional photos of items or storage areas</li>
    <li>Optional voice input to quickly log item names or descriptions</li>
  </ul>
  <p>All of this data remains strictly on your device and is never shared with us.</p>

  <h2>4. App Permissions and Usage</h2>
  <p>To provide specific features, FindIt may request access to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Microphone:</strong> For optional voice input. Audio is processed locally and not stored or transmitted.</li>
    <li><strong>Camera / Photos:</strong> To optionally attach item images. Stored only on your device.</li>
    <li><strong>Device Storage:</strong> To store your app data locally.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
  <p>Because all data is stored locally on your device, you are in full control. We do not have access to your data. If you uninstall the app or reset your device, your data may be lost unless backed up manually (e.g., via iCloud).</p>

  <h2>6. No Third-Party Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not share your data with advertisers, analytics platforms, or cloud services. FindIt is fully offline by design.</p>

  <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>FindIt is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children.</p>

  <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy. Changes will be posted within the app or on this page. Please review it periodically.</p>

  <h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions, contact us at:</p>
